HedgeDoc lets you create real-time collaborative markdown notes. Have a look at [our website](https://hedgedoc.org) for
more details.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ **Important:** We are currently working on HedgeDoc 2, a complete rewrite of HedgeDoc. Please note the following:

- This branch contains the latest development code and does not implement all features yet. **If you are looking for the
  1.x source code, have a look at the `master` branch.**
- HedgeDoc 2 will be split in two components: the backend (this repo) and the frontend in
  the [react-client repo](https://github.com/hedgedoc/react-client).
- The 1.x release is maintenance-only. We do not accept feature requests or PRs for this release anymore and may choose
  to close non-critical bug reports, if the bug will be non-existent in 2.0.
